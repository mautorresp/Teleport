[TELEPORT_AXIOMS_IMPLEMENTED]

H(L) = 16 + 8*leb_len(8*L)                    # Header bits
END(bitpos) = 3 + ((8 - ((bitpos+3) % 8)) % 8) # END positional cost
CAUS_stream(op, params, L) = 3 + 8*leb_len(op) + Σ 8*leb_len(param_i) + 8*leb_len(L)

[CRITICAL_CORRECTION_FROM_V3]

REMOVED: S-packing definition K = Σ S[i] * 256^(L-1-i)
This was FORBIDDEN under Teleport - seeds must be causal integers,
not base-256 numeralization of input bytes.

IMPLEMENTED: Teleport causal seed deduction
Seeds are deduced causal objects per Teleport/TOE specification,
not input re-expression in different base.

[MATHEMATICAL_PIPELINE_V4]

STAGE 1: Input Processing
- Input S: bytes of length L
- Integer-only arithmetic throughout (R0)
- SHA256 identity fingerprinting

STAGE 2: Header Cost (R1)
- H = header_bits(L) = 16 + 8*leb_len(8*L)
- Recomputed independently and verified

STAGE 3: Construction A (Teleport Causal)
- Deduce causal seed (NOT S-packing)
- Single CBD token with causal parameters
- If causal deduction incomplete: A_INCOMPLETE

STAGE 4: Construction B (CAUS-only tiling)
- CONST/STEP precedence with causal parameters
- All tokens must be bijection-complete
- Superadditivity check: B_stream ≥ A_stream

STAGE 5: Decision Algebra (R5)
- C_total = H + stream_total (exact arithmetic)
- min(H+A, H+B) = H + min(A, B) enforced
- Choose minimal construction

STAGE 6: Decision Gate (R7)
- EMIT iff C_total < 8*L
- Otherwise CAUSEFAIL(MINIMALITY_NOT_ACHIEVED)

STAGE 7: Bijection Validation (R9)
- For EMIT: reconstruct from tokens
- Verify SHA256(reconstructed) == SHA256(input)
- Re-encode and verify determinism (R8)

[RAILS_ENFORCEMENT_R0_R10]

R0: Integer-only everywhere (hard assert)
R1: Header lock H(L) recomputed and verified
R2: END positional from actual bitpos
R3: CAUS unit lock (no S-packing)
R4: Coverage exactness Σ token_L == L
R5: Algebra equality (double-header guard)
R6: Superadditivity B_stream ≥ A_stream
R7: Decision gate C_total < 8L
R8: Determinism receipts (double encode)
R9: Bijection receipts (expand + re-encode)
R10: Prediction rails (A_PRED/B_PRED match)

[FAIL_CLOSED_OPERATION]

Any rail failure prints RAIL_FAIL:<id> <diagnostic>
Processing continues to next object for complete audit
No silent degradation or approximation allowed
Integer-only arithmetic enforced throughout
