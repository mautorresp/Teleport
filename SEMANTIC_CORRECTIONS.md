## Semantic Corrections Applied to GitHub Repository

### ❌ REMOVED: Misleading "Compression" Language
**Problem:** Repository incorrectly described Teleport as a "compression library"
**Impact:** Semantic confusion breaking CLF principles - Teleport analyzes causality, not compression

### ✅ CORRECTED: Mathematical Causality Analysis System

**Repository Description:**
- **Before:** "Complete CLF Mathematical Causality System - Pure integer arithmetic for deterministic byte sequence analysis with formal verification"
- **After:** "CLF Mathematical Causality Analysis System - Pure integer arithmetic for deterministic byte sequence causality deduction with formal verification"

**README Title:**
- **Before:** "Integer-Only Compression and Processing Library"
- **After:** "CLF Mathematical Causality Analysis System"

**Core Purpose:**
- **Before:** "compression, encoding, and data processing"
- **After:** "determines whether byte sequences can be reproduced by deterministic generators"

### Key Semantic Fixes Applied:

1. **Features Section:**
   - ❌ Removed: "compression algorithms", "compression schemes"
   - ✅ Added: "Mathematical Generators", "Causality Proofs", "CLF Compliance"

2. **Examples Section:**
   - ❌ Removed: Huffman coding, compression cost calculations
   - ✅ Added: Generator deduction, causality testing, formal verification

3. **Use Cases Section:**
   - ❌ Removed: "Compression Libraries", "pack sensor data"
   - ✅ Added: "Forensic Analysis", "Reverse Engineering", "Cryptographic Analysis"

4. **Project Structure:**
   - ✅ Updated: Accurate module descriptions (generators.py, caus_deduction_complete.py)
   - ✅ Added: Evidence files, mathematical analysis tools

5. **Design Principles:**
   - ❌ Removed: "Integer-Only Operations" (generic)
   - ✅ Added: "Mathematical Causality Analysis", "CLF Compliance (CAUS-or-FAIL)"

### Critical Distinction Clarified:

**Teleport is NOT a compression system.** It is a mathematical causality analysis system that:
- Tests if byte sequences can be reproduced by deterministic generators
- Provides either formal proof (with exact parameters) or formal refutation
- Uses cost model C_CAUS for causality tokens, NOT compression efficiency
- Follows CLF principle: CAUS-or-FAIL with zero compromise

### Repository Status:
✅ **Semantically Accurate:** All compression references removed
✅ **CLF Compliant:** Clear mathematical causality focus
✅ **GitHub Updated:** Description, README, examples all corrected
✅ **No Confusion:** Purpose and functionality clearly defined

The repository now accurately represents Teleport as a mathematical causality analysis system with formal verification capabilities.
