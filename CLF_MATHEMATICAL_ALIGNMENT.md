CLF MATHEMATICAL CAUSALITY ALIGNMENT COMPLETE
==============================================

## PURGED COMPRESSION LOGIC

### ✅ Removed Concepts:
- "compression" terminology replaced with "mathematical causality"
- "efficiency" and "ratio" goals replaced with mathematical proof requirements
- "drastic minimality" replaced with "mathematical causality establishment"  
- "reduction" goals replaced with mathematical consequence observation
- All synthetic test data creation removed

### ✅ Core Realignment:
1. **Primary Purpose**: Mathematical causality deduction, not optimization
2. **Success Criteria**: Mathematical proof that generator can reconstruct bytes from parameters
3. **Failure Criteria**: No implemented generator can mathematically prove the input
4. **Parameter Size**: Consequence of mathematical structure, not optimization goal
5. **Cost Calculation**: Exact bit accounting for mathematical verification, not efficiency

### ✅ Language Corrections:
- `teleport/__init__.py`: "Mathematical Causality Calculator" 
- `teleport/clf_int.py`: "mathematical causality" utilities
- `clf_audit_demo.py`: "Parameter efficiency" (consequence, not goal)
- `caus_deduction_complete.py`: "Mathematical causality: ESTABLISHED"

### ✅ CLF Behavior Verified:
- **pic1.jpg result**: `CAUSE_NOT_DEDUCED` with quantified mathematical witnesses
- **Generator evaluation**: Each provides exact mismatch locations and mathematical failures
- **No false success**: CBD literal storage removed from success path
- **Honest reporting**: System properly reports mathematical failure instead of claiming false causality

## MATHEMATICAL CAUSALITY FOCUS

This is now purely a **binary calculator** that:
1. Takes byte sequences as mathematical input
2. Attempts mathematical proof via implemented generators  
3. Either establishes constructive mathematical causality OR reports honest failure
4. Calculates exact bit costs as mathematical verification
5. Enables perfect byte reproduction from parameters (if proof exists)

Any parameter size advantage is a **mathematical consequence**, not a design goal.
The system does mathematical deduction - period.

**Status**: CLF alignment complete. Pure mathematical causality focus established.
