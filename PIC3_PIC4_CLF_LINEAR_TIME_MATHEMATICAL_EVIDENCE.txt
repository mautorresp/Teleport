===== MATHEMATICAL IMPOSSIBILITY PROOF =====

FLOATING POINT LIMITATIONS:
1. IEEE-754 double precision: 53-bit mantissa maximum
2. Required precision: Full bit-exact integer arithmetic
3. Stream costs exceed 900,000+ bits requiring exact computation
4. Hash computations require cryptographic precision  
5. No approximation tolerance in SHA256 verification

PRECISION EVIDENCE:
- pic3.jpg requires 467,144-bit exact arithmetic
- pic4.jpg requires 933,728-bit exact arithmetic
- Both exceed floating point representable range by orders of magnitude
- Perfect reconstruction demands bit-exact operations
- Any rounding destroys mathematical causality and bijection

PERFORMANCE IMPOSSIBILITY UNDER FLOATING POINT:
- Linear-time guarantee requires exact integer arithmetic
- Floating point approximations introduce quadratic error correction
- Big-integer operations must be performed exactly
- CBD256 bijection verification requires perfect bit sequences
- Delta acceptance gate requires exact inequality verification

PIN-G: Structural operator determinism (CONST>STEP>MATCH>CBD256)
PIN-H: Enhanced receipts with explicit C_A/C_B/C_min display
