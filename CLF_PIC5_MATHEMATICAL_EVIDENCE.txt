=== MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS ===

=== MATHEMATICAL PROPERTIES VERIFIED ===
1. Integer-only operations: All cost calculations use pure integer arithmetic
2. Deterministic bijection: D ∘ C ∘ E = identity (when LEB7 aligned)
3. Exact coverage: Token intervals tile [0,L) with no gaps or overlaps
4. Seed-only parameterization: All operators use finite integer parameters
5. Mathematical minimality: Cost comparison uses exact integer equations

=== BASELINE COMPARISON ===
Raw file size: 555181 bytes
10*L baseline: 5551810 bits
CLF stream cost: 5075984 bits
Ratio to baseline: 0.9143
This is a mathematical consequence, not a compression goal

=== CONCLUSION ===
⚠️  Mathematical framework verified, technical alignment needed
