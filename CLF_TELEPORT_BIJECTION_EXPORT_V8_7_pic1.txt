CLF TELEPORT BIJECTION EXPORT V8.7 - CONSOLE VALIDATED
================================================================================
Generated: 2025-09-23T14:54:59

CLF stance pinned:
- Seeds forced by legality + unit-locked prices + strict comparison + deterministic tie-break
- Units are bits. Every integer field pays 8·leb_len(field)
- Bijection receipts: A-path contributes only if expand_O(params, L) == S byte-for-byte. B-path must satisfy exact coverage Σ L_token = L
- No floating point. No compression/entropy/pattern language. Only integer deduction consistent with Teleport

Console validation passed:
✓ H=32, B_stream=18400, TOTAL=18432, RAW=7744, Gate=CAUSEFAIL
✓ A inadmissible and excluded (NO_LAWFUL_OPERATOR_AVAILABLE)

[BIJECTION_METHODOLOGY_V8_7_LAWFUL_OPERATORS]
Mathematical stance: Bijection receipts only for ADMISSIBLE paths
A-path: SHA equality required between expand_O(params, L) and input S
B-path: Coverage exactness enforced (Σ L_token = L)
No placeholders, no false claims about non-existent operators

[MATHEMATICAL_FRAMEWORK_STATUS]
Current State: OPERATOR_INCOMPLETE (console validated)
- A-path framework ready but no lawful operators implemented
- B-path mathematically complete with unit-locked per-byte tiling
- System correctly fails-closed until lawful operators exist
- All bijection receipts honest (no false SHA claims)

Console Validation Evidence:
- pic1.jpg: H=32, B_stream=18400, TOTAL=18432, RAW=7744 ✓
- A inadmissible and excluded as expected ✓
- All values match theorem-locked calculations ✓

Required for A-path activation:
1. Implement admissible_O_attempt(S) → deterministic param extraction
2. Implement expand_O(params, L) → exact reconstruction
3. Verify SHA equality between input and expansion
4. Unit-locked pricing with K_O < 7688 bits for pic1.jpg EMIT

Mathematical guarantee: Any future A-operator must pass all receipts
or be rejected by the admissibility wall automatically.
