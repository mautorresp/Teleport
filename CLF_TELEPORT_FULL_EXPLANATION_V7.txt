[CRITICAL_V6_AUDIT_FIXES]

FIXED: Path completeness contract enforced
- Incomplete paths marked A_COMPLETE=False with TOTAL=N/A (not 0)
- Decision algebra operates on COMPLETE paths only
- No numeric placeholders for incomplete paths
- Bijection-complete token requirements enforced

[TELEPORT_AXIOMS_IMPLEMENTED]

H(L) = 16 + 8*leb_len(8*L)                    # Header bits
C_stream(op,...,L) = 3 + 8*leb_len(op) + Σ 8*leb_len(param_i) + 8*leb_len(L)  # CAUS only
END(p) = 3 + ((8 - ((p+3) % 8)) % 8)         # END positional cost
STREAM = CAUS + END                           # Total path stream cost
TOTAL = H(L) + STREAM                         # Total path cost

[PATH_COMPLETENESS_CONTRACT]

A path P is COMPLETE iff:
1. Coverage exact: Σ token_L == L
2. Every CAUS token cost recomputes exactly (unit lock)
3. Every END positional cost recomputes exactly
4. Bijection parameters present for all tokens in path
5. Bijection validation passes for all tokens in path

If any condition fails: P_COMPLETE = False, P_TOTAL = N/A
No numeric totals computed or used for incomplete paths

[DECISION_ALGEBRA_COMPLETENESS_ONLY]

CANDIDATES = { TOTAL_P | P ∈ {A,B} and P_COMPLETE }
If CANDIDATES is empty → CAUSEFAIL(BUILDER_INCOMPLETENESS)
Else:
- C_min_total = min(CANDIDATES)
- C_min_via_streams = min(H + STREAM_P for P in COMPLETE)
- Assert: C_min_total == C_min_via_streams
- C(S) = C_min_total

[STEP_SEMANTICS_EXPLICIT]

STEP token reconstruction: a_i = (start + i * stride) mod 256
Ensures bijection correctness over byte sequences of length L
All arithmetic modulo 256 for byte-level compatibility

[UNIVERSALITY_POLICY]

CAUS-only exporter policy:
- If CAUS tiling cannot generate S bijectively → CAUSEFAIL(BUILDER_INCOMPLETENESS)
- No silent 'OPEN success' or fallback approximations
- UNIVERSALITY_OK = False (CAUS-only, not full Teleport universality)

[MATHEMATICAL_PIPELINE_V7]

STAGE 1: Input Processing
- Input S: bytes of length L
- Integer-only arithmetic throughout (R0)
- SHA256 identity fingerprinting

STAGE 2: Predictions (R10) - END-inclusive
- A_PRED: Teleport causal seed → CAUS + END (if deducible)
- B_PRED: CAUS tiling structure → CAUS + END (if constructible)
- Status: COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE (no numeric values for INCOMPLETE)

STAGE 3: Construction Building with Completeness Contract
- A: Single causal seed token + END (if causal seed deducible)
- B: CAUS-only tiling + END (if bijective tiling possible)
- Path accounting: STREAM = CAUS + END (COMPLETE paths only)

STAGE 4: Decision Algebra (COMPLETE paths only)
- Compute TOTAL = H + STREAM for each COMPLETE path
- C(S) = min(TOTAL_P | P_COMPLETE) where available
- Enforce algebra equality on COMPLETE paths only

STAGE 5: Decision Gate (R7)
- EMIT iff C(S) < 8*L where C(S) from COMPLETE paths
- Otherwise CAUSEFAIL(MINIMALITY_NOT_ACHIEVED)

STAGE 6: Rails Validation (R0-R10)
- All rails enforced on COMPLETE paths with fail-closed operation
- R5: Algebra equality on COMPLETE candidate set only
- R10: Prediction equality matches path completeness

[RAILS_R0_R10_COMPLETENESS_CONTRACT]

R0: Integer-only guard (scan modules)
R1: Header lock H(L) recomputed verification
R2: END positional from actual bitpos (included in TOTAL)
R3: CAUS unit lock (no S-packing, bijection-complete tokens)
R4: Coverage exactness Σ token_L == L (COMPLETE paths)
R5: Algebra equality on COMPLETE candidate set only
R6: Superadditivity (CBD-split only, CAUS-only bypassed)
R7: Decision gate C(S) < 8*L where C(S) from COMPLETE paths
R8: Determinism receipts
R9: Bijection receipts (EMIT only)
R10: Prediction equality matches path completeness status

[FAIL_CLOSED_OPERATION]

Any rail failure prints RAIL_FAIL:<id> <diagnostic>
Processing continues for complete audit coverage
No silent degradation or approximation
Path completeness prevents algebra/decision mismatches
CAUSEFAIL(BUILDER_INCOMPLETENESS) when no complete paths exist
