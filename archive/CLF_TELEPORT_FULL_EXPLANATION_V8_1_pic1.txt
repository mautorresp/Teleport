[PINNED_AXIOMS_V8_1]
Single source of truth (calculator rails):
leb_len(n): 7-bit groups, if n=0 return 1
H(L) = 16 + 8*leb_len(8*L) (bits)
END(pos) = 3 + ((8-((pos+3)%8))%8) (bits)
C_CAUS(op,params,L) = 3 + 8*leb_len(op) + sum(8*leb_len(param_i)) + 8*leb_len(L)
All integers, no floats, no compression vocabulary

[CONSTRUCTIVE_PREDICTION_AS_FILTER_V8_1]
A_pred(S): Constructive causal seed derivation (no S-packing)
B_pred(S): Constructive CAUS tiling with exact coverage sum(L_i)=L
Hard binding: COMPLETE paths must have STREAM_obs == STREAM_pred
Fail-closed: INCOMPLETE predictors cannot be built

[PATH_COMPLETENESS_CONTRACT_V8_1]
P_COMPLETE = (pred COMPLETE) AND (build COMPLETE) AND (PRED==OBS)
If P_COMPLETE=False: P_STREAM=N/A, P_TOTAL=N/A, exclude from candidates

[FAIL_CLOSED_DECISION_ALGEBRA_V8_1]
Candidates C = {H+P_stream | P_COMPLETE}
If C=empty: CAUSEFAIL(BUILDER_INCOMPLETENESS)
Else: C(S) = min(C), verify min(H+A,H+B) = H+min(A,B)
EMIT gate: C(S) < 8*L, else CAUSEFAIL(MINIMALITY_NOT_ACHIEVED)

[DETERMINISM_AND_RECEIPTS_V8_1]
Double encode: bit-for-bit identical
EMIT receipts: SHA256_IN == SHA256_OUT
Integer-only logs, single-pass computation
