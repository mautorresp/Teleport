CLF TELEPORT PREDICTION EXPORT V8.7 - CONSOLE VALIDATED
================================================================================
Generated: 2025-09-23T14:54:59

CLF stance pinned:
- Seeds forced by legality + unit-locked prices + strict comparison + deterministic tie-break
- Units are bits. Every integer field pays 8·leb_len(field)
- Path prices END-inclusive: STREAM = Σ CAUS(tokens) + Σ END(tokens)
- Predictor binding theorem: For COMPLETE paths, STREAM_obs == Π_path(S)
- No floating point. No compression/entropy/pattern language. Only integer deduction consistent with Teleport

Console validation passed:
✓ H=32, B_stream=18400, TOTAL=18432, RAW=7744, Gate=CAUSEFAIL
✓ Algebra equality: C_min_total == C_min_via_streams == 18432
✓ B predictor binding: Π_B(S) == STREAM_obs enforced

[PREDICTION_METHODOLOGY_V8_7_LAWFUL_BINDING]
Predictor binding theorem: For COMPLETE paths, STREAM_obs == Π_path(S)
A-predictor: Uses same operator detection as A-builder (currently incomplete)
B-predictor: Uses same unit-locked equations as B-builder (always complete)
Zero-guessing global: Π(S) = min(literal_fallback, available_path_predictors)
Drift protection: Any predictor/builder disagreement triggers immediate rail failure

[MATHEMATICAL_PREDICTOR_FRAMEWORK_STATUS]

Current Predictor Completeness (console validated):
- A-path predictor: INCOMPLETE (no lawful operators available)
- B-path predictor: COMPLETE (unit-locked equations enforced)
- Global predictor: COMPLETE (literal fallback + available paths)

Console Validation Evidence:
- pic1.jpg: Π_B(S)=18400, STREAM_obs=18400, binding=True ✓
- Decision algebra: C_min_total == C_min_via_streams == 18432 ✓
- Gate decision: CAUSEFAIL (18432 >= 7744) ✓

Drift Protection Active:
- B-path binding theorem enforced: Π_B(S) == STREAM_obs
- Any builder/predictor disagreement triggers immediate rail failure
- Zero-guessing global predictor prevents search/optimization

Required for A-path predictor activation:
1. Same operator detection logic as A-builder
2. Same unit-locked pricing equations as A-builder
3. Binding theorem: Π_A(S) == STREAM_obs when A_COMPLETE
4. Automatic rail failure if predictor/builder disagree

Mathematical guarantee: When lawful A-operator exists, predictor binding
will be enforced by the same theorem that currently locks B-path.
