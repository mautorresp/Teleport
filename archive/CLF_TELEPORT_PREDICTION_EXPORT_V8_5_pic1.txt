PER-PATH PREDICTOR BINDING WITH THEOREM-LOCKED RAILS

[PREDICTION_METHODOLOGY_V8_5]
RAIL P1: For every COMPLETE path P, require STREAM_obs == Π_P(S)
predict_A_from_S(S): Compute A-path stream using same equations A builder uses
predict_B_from_S(S): Compute B-path stream using same equations B builder uses
Zero-Guessing Global Predictor: Π(S) = min(C_LIT(L), available Π_path(S))

PER_PATH_PREDICTOR_BINDING:

  predict_A_from_S(S) ANALYSIS:
    Status: N/A_INADMISSIBLE
    Reason: A-path fails Rail A1 (bijection wall)
    A_COMPLETE: False
    Predicted: N/A
    Observed: N/A
    RAIL_P1_BINDING: N/A (path inadmissible)
    
  predict_B_from_S(S) ANALYSIS:
    Method: Per-byte CAUS tiling recomputation
    Tokens: 968 × (op=1, params=[], L=1)
    Predicted_Calculation:
      CAUS_Total: 968 × C_CAUS(op=1, [], L=1) = 968 × 19 = 18,392
      END_Cost: END(18392) = 8
      Predicted_Stream: 18,400
    Observed_Stream: 18,400
    RAIL_P1_BINDING: PRED_18400_OBS_18400_EQ_True ✓
    B_COMPLETE: True

ZERO_GUESSING_GLOBAL_PREDICTOR:
  Available_Components:
    C_LIT(L): 10 × 968 = 9,680 (literal fallback)
    Π_A(S): N/A (path inadmissible)
    Π_B(S): 18,400 (bound and verified)
    
  Π(S): min(9680, 18400) = 9,680
  Π_reason: LITERAL_FALLBACK
  
  PREDICTOR_PURPOSE: Baseline calculator for drift detection
  
BUILDER_COMPARISON:
  Valid_Candidates: [18432] (H + B_STREAM = 32 + 18400)
  C_min_total: 18,432
  Builder_Decision: CAUSEFAIL (18432 ≥ 7744)

FILTER_VERIFICATION:
  Threshold: 8 × 968 = 7,744
  Π_would_emit: False (9680 ≥ 7744)
  Builder_would_emit: False (18432 ≥ 7744)
  Gate_Agreement: True ✓
  
BINDING_STATUS_SUMMARY:
✓ RAIL_P1_A: N/A (A inadmissible - correct exclusion)
✓ RAIL_P1_B: True (Π_B(S) == B_STREAM exactly)
✓ Gate_Agreement: Both predictor and builder agree on CAUSEFAIL
✓ Theorem-Locked: Any stream mispricing will fail P1 binding immediately

MATHEMATICAL_CONCLUSION:
Per-path predictor binding successfully enforced.
B-path stream cost verified through equation recomputation.
A-path correctly excluded until bijection proven.
System drift-proof through calculator-grade equality checks.
