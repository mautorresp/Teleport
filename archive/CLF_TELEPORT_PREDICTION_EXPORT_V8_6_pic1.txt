[PREDICTION_METHODOLOGY_V8_6_LAWFUL_BINDING]
Predictor binding theorem: For COMPLETE paths, STREAM_obs == Π_path(S)
A-predictor: Uses same operator detection as A-builder (currently incomplete)
B-predictor: Uses same unit-locked equations as B-builder (always complete)
Zero-guessing global: Π(S) = min(literal_fallback, available_path_predictors)
Drift protection: Any predictor/builder disagreement triggers immediate rail failure

[MATHEMATICAL_PREDICTOR_FRAMEWORK_STATUS]

Current Predictor Completeness:
- A-path predictor: INCOMPLETE (no lawful operators available)
- B-path predictor: COMPLETE (unit-locked equations enforced)
- Global predictor: COMPLETE (literal fallback + available paths)

Drift Protection Active:
- B-path binding theorem enforced: Π_B(S) == STREAM_obs
- Any builder/predictor disagreement triggers immediate rail failure
- Zero-guessing global predictor prevents search/optimization

Required for A-path predictor activation:
1. Same operator detection logic as A-builder
2. Same unit-locked pricing equations as A-builder
3. Binding theorem: Π_A(S) == STREAM_obs when A_COMPLETE
4. Automatic rail failure if predictor/builder disagree

Mathematical guarantee: When lawful A-operator exists, predictor binding
will be enforced by the same theorem that currently locks B-path.
