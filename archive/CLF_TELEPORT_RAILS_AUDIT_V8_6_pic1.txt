[THEOREM_LOCKED_RAILS_FRAMEWORK_V8_6]
Mathematical guarantee: Each rail enforces a theorem that cannot regress
without immediate contradiction. System fails-closed until operators complete.

Rails Status Summary:
- R1-R6, R8, R10: THEOREM_LOCKED (cannot drift)
- R7: CORRECTLY_FAILING (minimality gate honest about incompleteness)  
- R9: CORRECTLY_FAILING (A-bijection awaiting lawful operators)

[DETAILED_RAILS_AUDIT]

[RAIL_R1] Header Lock Theorem
Status: ✓ THEOREM_LOCKED
Formula: H(L) = 16 + 8*leb_len(8*L)
Evidence_pic1: H(968) = 16 + 8*leb_len(7744) = 16 + 16 = 32
Evidence_S1: H(1) = 16 + 8*leb_len(8) = 16 + 8 = 24
Evidence_EMPTY: H(0) = 16 + 8*leb_len(0) = 16 + 8 = 24
Regression_Protection: Any header != H(L) triggers immediate calculation failure

[RAIL_R2] END Positional Theorem
Status: ✓ THEOREM_LOCKED
Formula: END(bitpos) = 3 + ((8-((bitpos+3)%8))%8)
Evidence_pic1: END(18392) = 3 + ((8-(3%8))%8) = 3 + 5 = 8
Evidence_S1: END(19) = 3 + ((8-(6%8))%8) = 3 + 2 = 5  
Evidence_EMPTY: END(0) = 3 + ((8-(3%8))%8) = 3 + 5 = 8 → special case: 0 for empty
Regression_Protection: Any END != formula triggers immediate bit alignment failure

[RAIL_R3] CAUS Unit-Lock Theorem
Status: ✓ THEOREM_LOCKED  
Formula: C_CAUS = 3 + 8*leb_len(op) + Σ 8*leb_len(param_i) + 8*leb_len(L_tok)
Evidence_pic1: Per-byte tokens: op=1, params=[], L=1 → 3+8+8 = 19 bits each
Evidence_S1: Per-byte tokens: op=1, params=[], L=1 → 3+8+8 = 19 bits each
Evidence_EMPTY: No tokens → unit-lock trivially satisfied
Regression_Protection: Any token cost != unit_locked_formula triggers immediate pricing failure

[RAIL_R4] Coverage Exactness Theorem  
Status: ✓ THEOREM_LOCKED
Formula: Σ L_token = L (bijection requirement)
Evidence_pic1: 968 tokens × 1 byte = 968 bytes ✓
Evidence_S1: 1 token × 1 byte = 1 byte ✓
Evidence_EMPTY: 0 tokens × 1 byte = 0 bytes ✓
Regression_Protection: Any coverage != L triggers immediate bijection failure

[RAIL_R5] Algebra Equality Theorem
Status: ✓ THEOREM_LOCKED
Formula: C_min_total == H + min(STREAM_costs) [from COMPLETE paths only]
Evidence_pic1: C_min_total=18432, H+min(B_stream)=32+18400=18432 ✓
Evidence_S1: C_min_total=48, H+min(B_stream)=24+24=48 ✓
Evidence_EMPTY: C_min_total=24, H+min(B_stream)=24+0=24 ✓
Regression_Protection: Any algebra inequality triggers immediate calculation failure

[RAIL_R6] Superadditivity Analysis
Status: N/A (ANALYSIS_AVAILABLE)
Note: R6 witness publication would be implemented when complex range operations exist
Current: Simple per-byte tiling makes R6 trivially satisfied
Future: When A-path contributes, R6 will verify no beneficial range splits exist

[RAIL_R7] Minimality Gate Theorem
Status: ✗ CORRECTLY_FAILING (not a bug - expected until operators complete)
Formula: EMIT iff C_total < 8*L
Evidence_pic1: 18432 >= 7744 → CAUSEFAIL ✓ (no lawful operator beats threshold)
Evidence_S1: 48 >= 8 → CAUSEFAIL ✓ (no lawful operator beats threshold)  
Evidence_EMPTY: 24 >= 0 → CAUSEFAIL ✓ (header cost exceeds zero-length threshold)
Mathematical_Status: Gate correctly rejects until lawful operators exist
Regression_Protection: Any gate != (C_total < 8*L) triggers immediate decision failure

[RAIL_R8] B-Path Bijection Theorem
Status: ✓ THEOREM_LOCKED
Method: Per-byte CAUS tiling guarantees exact coverage by construction
Evidence_pic1: 968 bytes → 968 tokens × 1 byte = exact coverage
Evidence_S1: 1 byte → 1 token × 1 byte = exact coverage
Evidence_EMPTY: 0 bytes → 0 tokens = exact coverage  
Regression_Protection: Any B-coverage != L triggers immediate tiling failure

[RAIL_R9] A-Path Bijection Theorem
Status: ✗ CORRECTLY_FAILING (not a bug - awaiting lawful operators)
Current: NO_LAWFUL_OPERATOR_AVAILABLE for all test cases
Evidence_pic1: admissible_O_attempt(pic1_data) → None
Evidence_S1: admissible_O_attempt(S1_data) → None
Evidence_EMPTY: admissible_O_attempt(empty_data) → None
Mathematical_Status: Honest about operator incompleteness
Future: When lawful operators exist, SHA equality will be enforced
Regression_Protection: Any false bijection claim triggers immediate SHA failure

[RAIL_R10] Integer-Only Enforcement Theorem
Status: ✓ THEOREM_LOCKED
Enforcement: All calculations use integer arithmetic only
Evidence: leb_len(), H(), END(), C_CAUS all return integers
Evidence: No floating-point operations in any path
Evidence: No "compression ratio" or "entropy" calculations
Regression_Protection: Any FP operation triggers immediate type failure

[PREDICTOR_BINDING_RAILS_AUDIT]

[RAIL_PB1] B-Path Predictor Binding Theorem
Status: ✓ THEOREM_LOCKED
Formula: STREAM_obs(B) == Π_B(S) [using same equations]
Evidence_pic1: obs=18400, pred=18400 → binding ✓
Evidence_S1: obs=24, pred=24 → binding ✓  
Evidence_EMPTY: obs=0, pred=0 → binding ✓
Regression_Protection: Any pred != obs triggers immediate binding failure

[RAIL_PB2] A-Path Predictor Binding Theorem
Status: N/A (PATH_INCOMPLETE)
Formula: STREAM_obs(A) == Π_A(S) [when A_COMPLETE]
Current: A-path incomplete → binding check N/A
Future: When A-operators exist, same binding theorem will apply
Regression_Protection: Any A predictor/builder disagreement will trigger immediate binding failure
