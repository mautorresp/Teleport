[TELEPORT_AXIOMS_IMPLEMENTED]

H(L) = 16 + 8*leb_len(8*L)                    # Header bits
END(p) = 3 + ((8 - ((p+3) % 8)) % 8)         # END positional cost
C_stream = 3 + 8*leb_len(op) + Σ 8*leb_len(param_i) + 8*leb_len(L)

[SURGICAL_CORRECTIONS_FROM_V4]

FIXED: Double-header leak in decision algebra
- Single C(S) source of truth enforced
- Algebra equality: min(H+A, H+B) = H + min(A, B) asserted

CORRECTED: R6 superadditivity specification
- Only applies to CBD-split cases: Σ C_CBD_parts ≥ C_CBD_whole
- CAUS-only constructions bypass R6

COMPLETED: R10 prediction rails
- A_PRED: from Teleport causal seed deduction
- B_PRED: from declared CAUS tiling structure
- Requires PRED == OBS when status COMPLETE

STABILIZED: Small-L rail behavior
- R3 (CAUS unit lock) handles L=0 gracefully
- R7 (decision gate) deterministic for all L

[MATHEMATICAL_PIPELINE_V5]

STAGE 1: Input Processing
- Input S: bytes of length L
- Integer-only arithmetic throughout (R0)
- SHA256 identity fingerprinting

STAGE 2: Predictions (R10)
- A_PRED: Teleport causal seed deduction
- B_PRED: CAUS tiling structure analysis
- Status: COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE

STAGE 3: Construction Building
- A: Single causal seed token (if deducible)
- B: CAUS-only tiling (CONST/STEP precedence)

STAGE 4: Decision Algebra (Single Source)
- H = H_header(L)
- A_total = H + A_stream (if A complete)
- B_total = H + B_stream (if B complete)
- C_min_total = min(A_total, B_total)
- C_min_via_streams = H + min(A_stream, B_stream)
- ASSERT: C_min_total == C_min_via_streams
- C(S) = C_min_total (single value)

STAGE 5: Decision Gate (R7)
- EMIT iff C(S) < 8*L
- Otherwise CAUSEFAIL(MINIMALITY_NOT_ACHIEVED)

STAGE 6: Rails Validation (R0-R10)
- All rails enforced with fail-closed operation
- Precise diagnostics for any failures

[RAILS_R0_R10_CORRECTED]

R0: Integer-only guard (scan modules)
R1: Header lock H(L) recomputed verification
R2: END positional from actual bitpos
R3: CAUS unit lock (no S-packing, stable for L=0)
R4: Coverage exactness Σ token_L == L
R5: Algebra equality (double-header guard)
R6: Superadditivity (CBD-split only, CAUS-only bypassed)
R7: Decision gate C(S) < 8*L
R8: Determinism receipts
R9: Bijection receipts (EMIT only)
R10: Prediction equality A_PRED==A_OBS, B_PRED==B_OBS

[FAIL_CLOSED_OPERATION]

Any rail failure prints RAIL_FAIL:<id> <diagnostic>
Processing continues for complete audit coverage
No silent degradation or approximation
Single C(S) prevents double-header arithmetic errors
