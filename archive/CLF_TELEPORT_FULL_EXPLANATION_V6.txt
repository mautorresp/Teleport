[CRITICAL_V5_AUDIT_FIX]

FIXED: END bits included in totals
- V5 computed END(p) but excluded from decision algebra
- V6 enforces END-inclusive STREAM = CAUS + END for all paths
- Decision algebra: TOTAL = H + STREAM where STREAM includes END
- Algebra equality: min(H+STREAM_A, H+STREAM_B) = H + min(STREAM_A, STREAM_B)

[TELEPORT_AXIOMS_IMPLEMENTED]

H(L) = 16 + 8*leb_len(8*L)                    # Header bits
C_stream(op,...,L) = 3 + 8*leb_len(op) + Σ 8*leb_len(param_i) + 8*leb_len(L)  # CAUS only
END(p) = 3 + ((8 - ((p+3) % 8)) % 8)         # END positional cost
STREAM = CAUS + END                           # Total path stream cost
TOTAL = H(L) + STREAM                         # Total path cost

[END_INCLUSIVE_ACCOUNTING]

For each path P ∈ {A, B}:
- CAUS_P = Σ C_stream(tokens_P)  # Sum of CAUS token costs
- END_P = Σ END(bitpos)          # Sum of END token costs
- STREAM_P = CAUS_P + END_P      # Total stream cost
- TOTAL_P = H(L) + STREAM_P      # Total path cost

Decision algebra (single source):
- C_min_total = min(TOTAL_A, TOTAL_B)
- C_min_via_streams = min(H + STREAM_A, H + STREAM_B)
- Assert: C_min_total == C_min_via_streams
- C(S) = C_min_total

[MATHEMATICAL_PIPELINE_V6]

STAGE 1: Input Processing
- Input S: bytes of length L
- Integer-only arithmetic throughout (R0)
- SHA256 identity fingerprinting

STAGE 2: Predictions (R10) - END-inclusive
- A_PRED: Teleport causal seed → CAUS + END
- B_PRED: CAUS tiling structure → CAUS + END
- Status: COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE

STAGE 3: Construction Building
- A: Single causal seed token + END
- B: CAUS-only tiling + END
- Path accounting: STREAM = CAUS + END

STAGE 4: Decision Algebra (END-inclusive)
- Compute TOTAL = H + STREAM for each complete path
- C(S) = min(TOTAL_A, TOTAL_B) where available
- Enforce algebra equality on STREAM (not CAUS-only)

STAGE 5: Decision Gate (R7)
- EMIT iff C(S) < 8*L
- Otherwise CAUSEFAIL(MINIMALITY_NOT_ACHIEVED)

STAGE 6: Rails Validation (R0-R10)
- R2: END positional included in path totals
- R5: Algebra equality on END-inclusive STREAM
- All other rails enforced with fail-closed operation

[RAILS_R0_R10_END_INCLUSIVE]

R0: Integer-only guard (scan modules)
R1: Header lock H(L) recomputed verification
R2: END positional from actual bitpos (included in TOTAL)
R3: CAUS unit lock (no S-packing, stable for L=0)
R4: Coverage exactness Σ token_L == L
R5: Algebra equality on END-inclusive STREAM (double-header guard)
R6: Superadditivity (CBD-split only, CAUS-only bypassed)
R7: Decision gate C(S) < 8*L where C(S) includes END
R8: Determinism receipts
R9: Bijection receipts (EMIT only)
R10: Prediction equality A_PRED==A_STREAM, B_PRED==B_STREAM (END-inclusive)

[FAIL_CLOSED_OPERATION]

Any rail failure prints RAIL_FAIL:<id> <diagnostic>
Processing continues for complete audit coverage
No silent degradation or approximation
END-inclusive bit accounting prevents under-counting
