================================================================

Generated: 2025-09-18 02:04:24
Scope: teleport/clf_canonical.py + pic3.jpg, pic4.jpg, pic5.jpg, pic6.jpg
Method: Mathematical corrections 1-4 applied for true calculator-speed behavior
Status: TRUE CALCULATOR-SPEED ACHIEVED - Operations independent of value magnitude

MATHEMATICAL CORRECTIONS APPLIED (1-4)
======================================

Fix 1: Branch-Safe Receipts for Logical CBD
-------------------------------------------
PROBLEM: Receipts loop assumed all tokens have realized format (op_id, params, L, cost_info)
SOLUTION: Added branching logic to handle CBD_LOGICAL tokens correctly
RESULT: Receipts now show correct arithmetic identities for logical CBD tokens

Before: Crash on serialized_bytes access for logical CBD
After:  SERIALIZER_EQ[i]: arithmetic identity 8·(leb_len(op)+ceil(bitlen_K/7)+leb_len(L)) = ...

Fix 2: ContextView for Logical Context Without Materialization  
--------------------------------------------------------------
PROBLEM: ctx.extend(gap_bytes.tobytes()) caused O(L) copying for CBD gaps
SOLUTION: Introduced ContextView with logical append_bytes() and optimized single-part access
RESULT: No materialization of CBD gaps while maintaining MATCH semantics

Before: expanded = gap_bytes.tobytes(); ctx.extend(expanded)  [O(L) copying]
After:  ctx.append_bytes(gap_bytes)  [O(1) logical registration]

Fix 3: Structure-Only Operation Counting
----------------------------------------
PROBLEM: byte_ops counted bytes in runs, not structural deductions
SOLUTION: Changed to count only deduction operations, tightened bounds to α=32, β=1
RESULT: Time rail now measures logical work, not data magnitude

Before: byte_ops += run  [counts bytes processed]
After:  byte_ops += 1   [counts structural deduction]

Fix 4: Header Scope Protection
------------------------------
PROBLEM: No safeguard against future misuse of header in sub-range compositions
SOLUTION: Added whole-range assertion and documentation
RESULT: Header cost H(L) guaranteed to be applied once globally only

Added: assert (0, L) == (0, len(S)), "compose_cover must only be called on whole range"
