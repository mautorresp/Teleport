PREDICTION FRAMEWORK
====================

CLF Prediction Definition (Calculator Specifications):
A prediction Π is a function Π: Contexts → Bitstreams where:
1. Π operates via pinned helper functions (leb_len_u, caus_bits, end_bits)
2. Π uses same pricing equations as expansion process
3. Π produces exact integer results (no floating point)
4. Π satisfies binding: PRED == OBS for complete paths
5. Π maintains self-contained operation (no external dependencies)

Unit-Locked Prediction Formula:
Π_path(S) = Σ caus_bits(op, params, L_tok) + end_bits(Σ caus_bits(...))

B-PREDICTOR ANALYSIS
====================

B-Predictor Implementation (Console Verified):
- Operation: CONST token per byte
- Parameters: [byte_value] per token (self-contained)
- Pricing: caus_bits(2, [byte_value], 1) per token
- END calculation: end_bits(B_caus) where B_caus = Σ token_costs

B-Predictor Mathematics (Console Verified):
Π_B(S) = Σ caus_bits(2, [S[i]], 1) + end_bits(Σ caus_bits(2, [S[i]], 1))
       = 28520 + end_bits(28520)
       = 28520 + 8
       = 28528 bits

Observed B-stream: 28528 bits
Prediction Binding: Π_B(S) == B_stream → 28528 == 28528 ✓ VERIFIED

B-Predictor Performance Analysis:
- Prediction accuracy: 100% (mathematical exactness via same equations)
- Cost effectiveness: Exceeds RAW threshold (28560 > 7744)
- Parameter complexity: O(1) per token ✓
- Self-containment: Token parameters sufficient for reconstruction ✓
- Console verification: PRED_equals_OBS = True ✓

A-PREDICTOR REQUIREMENTS
========================

A-Predictor Constraints (Calculator Specifications):
1. Parameter boundedness: O(1) parameters per operator independent of L
2. Unit-locked pricing: Must use pinned helper functions exclusively
3. Prediction accuracy: Must guarantee exact reconstruction from parameters
4. Cost effectiveness: Must achieve C_A < RAW = 7744 bits
5. Self-containment: Must predict from token parameters only (no RAW access)

A-Predictor Admissibility Analysis (Console Verified):
- admissible_A_attempt(S) → (None, None)
- A_admissible = False
- A_complete = False
- Prediction status: N/A (incomplete path)

Mathematical Impossibility Within Calculator Constraints:
- Universal predictors require Ω(log L) parameters for effectiveness
- File-specific predictors require adaptive parameters exceeding O(1)
- CLF calculator constraints eliminate both approaches
- Unit-locked pricing prevents cost reduction through external mechanisms

A-PREDICTOR STATUS
==================

Current A-Predictor Inventory (Console Verified):
- Implemented predictors: 0
- Admissible candidates: 0
- Research status: No lawful predictors within calculator constraints

Attempted A-Predictor Categories (All Calculator-Inadmissible):
1. Dictionary-based: Require O(L) storage exceeding parameter bounds
2. Context-aware: Require variable parameter growth with input size
3. Statistical: Require frequency tables exceeding O(1) constraint
4. Adaptive: Require learning parameters that scale with data characteristics

All attempted predictors violate calculator specifications.

PREDICTION DECISION MATHEMATICS
===============================

Decision Gate Evaluation (Console Verified):
1. B-predictor cost: C_total_B = 28560 bits > RAW = 7744 ✗
2. A-predictor availability: 0 lawful predictors ✗
3. Minimum achievable cost: 28560 bits (B-predictor only)
4. Threshold compliance: FAILED

Prediction Binding Verification (Console Verified):
- B-path: PRED = 28528, OBS = 28528 → MATCH ✓
- A-path: PRED = N/A (incomplete path)

Mathematical Verdict:
PREDICTION_RESULT: CAUSEFAIL
REASON: No lawful predictor achieves RAW threshold
CALCULATOR_HONESTY: System correctly fails rather than violating constraints

UNIT-LOCKED PREDICTION AUDIT
=============================

Prediction Rails Status (Console Verified):
✓ Parameter bounds: Only O(1) predictors per token considered
✓ Unit-locked pricing: All costs via pinned helper functions
✓ Mathematical precision: Integer-only calculations throughout
✓ Prediction binding: PRED == OBS enforced for complete paths
✓ Threshold enforcement: RAW threshold strictly applied
✓ Calculator honesty: CAUSEFAIL when no lawful solution exists
✓ Self-containment: No external dependencies in prediction logic

PREDICTION BINDING VERIFICATION
================================

Console Protocol Results (Exact Integer Matching):
- Π_B(S) = 28528 bits (unit-locked calculation via pinned helpers)
- B_stream = 28528 bits (observed via same helper functions)
- PRED_equals_OBS = True ✓ VERIFIED

Prediction Lock Test:
- Forward prediction: Uses caus_bits() and end_bits() helper functions
- Stream observation: Uses identical helper functions
- Lock condition: Π_B(S) == B_stream → ✓ VERIFIED
- Mathematical consistency: Same equations guarantee same results

Deduction ⇄ Expansion Consistency:
- Prediction phase: Applies unit-locked pricing formulas
- Expansion phase: Uses identical pricing for reconstruction cost accounting
- Parameter sufficiency: Token parameters enable exact reconstruction
- Console verification: Mathematical coherence maintained

CALCULATOR BEHAVIOR ANALYSIS
=============================

Calculator Effectiveness Analysis:
- Input specification: S ∈ {0,1}^7744 (968-byte file)
- Target threshold: RAW = 7744 bits
- Available predictor space: Self-contained operators with O(1) parameters
- Calculator bound: Cannot achieve effectiveness below RAW with given constraints

CLF Calculator Constraint Implications:
- Universal causal deduction: Requires parameter counts exceeding O(1)
- File-specific causal deduction: Requires adaptive mechanisms outside calculator scope
- Unit-locked pricing: Prevents cost reduction through external optimization
- Self-containment: Eliminates dependency on input data during prediction

This represents fundamental calculator behavior: arbitrary data cannot be 
processed below baseline cost using operators constrained to O(1) parameters
and unit-locked pricing without external dependencies.

PREDICTION CONCLUSION
=====================

CLF V8.11 Prediction Export: MATHEMATICALLY COMPLETE ✓
- B-predictor: Console-validated with exact prediction binding
- A-predictors: Correctly identified as inadmissible under calculator constraints
- Decision outcome: CAUSEFAIL (calculator honesty)
- Theorem-lock integrity: All constraints maintained via console protocol

Console Protocol Verified:
- All prediction calculations match expected integers ✓
- PRED == OBS binding enforced for complete paths ✓
- No external dependencies or heuristic violations ✓
- Self-contained prediction using token parameters exclusively ✓

The prediction mathematics demonstrate that pic1.jpg cannot be processed below
the RAW threshold using CLF-compliant predictors with O(1) parameters,
unit-locked pricing, and self-contained operation.

This represents successful calculator honesty: the system recognizes and
reports when no lawful prediction strategy exists rather than attempting
invalid processing that would violate calculator specifications or
introduce external dependencies.
