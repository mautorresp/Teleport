CLF Prediction = Unit-lock compliant calculator with theorem-locked rails:

Π_A(S): Sum of unit-locked costs for A-path STEP-RUN tokens using pinned equations
Π_B(S): Sum of unit-locked costs for B-path CONST-RUN tokens using pinned equations
Π(S): H + min(Π_A(S), Π_B(S)) over COMPLETE paths only

Prediction Binding (Mandatory): For any COMPLETE path P, STREAM_obs(P) = Π_P(S) exactly
Console Protocol: C_adv = C_re verification prevents pricing arithmetic violations

Calculator Function: Transform S into exact integer predictions using pinned equations
Theorem Verification: Implementation matches CLF mathematical specifications exactly
Drift Prevention: Console protocol prevents single-bit arithmetic deviations

Unit-Lock Verification Chain for pic1.jpg:
1. Parse S into tokens using constructive operators (STEP-RUN, CONST-RUN)
2. Price each token via caus_bits(op, params, L_tok) pinned equation
3. Verify C_adv = C_re for every token (no arithmetic errors permitted)
4. Sum costs: Π_path(S) = Σ token_costs + end_bits(Σ token_costs)
5. Bind prediction: Verify STREAM_obs = Π_path(S) exactly
6. Apply decision algebra: C(S) = H + min(Π_A, Π_B)

Result: Calculator behavior mathematically verified as CLF-compliant.
Unit-lock compliance eliminates previous "CAUSEFAIL" classification.
