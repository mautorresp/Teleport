CLF TELEPORT BIJECTION EXPORT V8.6 - OPERATOR COMPLETENESS FOCUS

[BIJECTION_METHODOLOGY_V8_6_LAWFUL_OPERATORS]
Mathematical stance: Bijection receipts only for ADMISSIBLE paths
A-path: SHA equality required between expand_O(params, L) and input S
B-path: Coverage exactness enforced (Σ L_token = L)
No placeholders, no false claims about non-existent operators

[MATHEMATICAL_FRAMEWORK_STATUS]
Current State: OPERATOR_INCOMPLETE
- A-path framework ready but no lawful operators implemented
- B-path mathematically complete with unit-locked per-byte tiling
- System correctly fails-closed until lawful operators exist
- All bijection receipts honest (no false SHA claims)

Required for A-path activation:
1. Implement admissible_O_attempt(S) → deterministic param extraction
2. Implement expand_O(params, L) → exact reconstruction
3. Verify SHA equality between input and expansion
4. Unit-locked pricing with K_O < 7688 bits for pic1.jpg EMIT

Mathematical guarantee: Any future A-operator must pass all receipts
or be rejected by the admissibility wall automatically.
