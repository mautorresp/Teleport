CLF ΔΩ-U^B SPECIFICATION MANDATORY UPGRADE COMPLETE
=================================================

All mandatory alignment requirements have been implemented:

✅ B1: CAUS Mapping Implementation
- Replaced OP_CBD=9 with normative CAUS tokens
- A builder now returns (C_A_stream, tokens_A) with CAUS(op, params, L) only
- Implemented OP_CONST, OP_STEP, OP_MATCH, OP_U_B per specification
- Eliminated all CBD primitive references

✅ B2: S-Packing Elimination 
- Removed all code paths that group bits of S as 'seed'
- Only op-parameter deduction (A) or structural tiling (B) allowed  
- Added unit test that fails if seed length scales as Θ(L)
- Mathematical parameters bounded to O(1) size regardless of input length

✅ B3: END Cost Fix
- Replaced END_BITS=8 constant with computed end_bits = 3 + pad_to_byte(pos+3)
- Added position tracking throughout token emission
- Enforced pad bits are zeros with range validation [3,10]
- Updated all cost calculations to use actual END computation

✅ B4: LEB Unit Lock Enforcement
- Added pinned macro C_bits_of(*ints) for all field cost computations
- Wrapped every integer field emission with single leb_len(field)
- Added rail test forbidding leb_len(8*L) outside header code
- Verified unit lock compliance across all token types

✅ B5: A/B Independence & Receipts
- Both builders always publish full receipts (C_stream, tokens, coverage)
- Proper B_COMPLETE=False handling with mathematical diagnostics
- If both incomplete → CAUSEFAIL/BUILDER_INCOMPLETENESS (never blame data)
- Separated function calls with independent mathematical paths

✅ B6: Float Sentinel Removal
- Replaced float('inf') with None and explicit None branches
- All arithmetic maintains integer-only typing
- No FP contamination in any cost calculations or decision logic

✅ C: 10 Pinned Drift-Killer Assertions
1. Header lock: assert H == 16 + 8*leb_len(8*L) with minimality verification
2. Unit lock: verify all token costs match tag_bits + Σ8*leb_len(field)
3. END pad: enforce pad_bits == 0 and valid range [3,10]
4. Coverage: assert Σ token_lengths == L for chosen path
5. Builder separation: independent build_A_exact_aligned / build_B_structural_aligned
6. Superadditivity: CBD-only B case enforces Σ C_B_split ≥ C_A_whole
7. Decision equality: C_min == H+min(C_A,C_B) == min(H+C_A,H+C_B)
8. Minimality gate: EMIT iff C(S) < 8L, else CAUSEFAIL with diagnostics
9. Integer-only rail: isinstance(x, int) for all measured quantities
10. Vocabulary rail: mathematical deduction language, no compression terms

✅ A3: Decision Equation Dual Factorization
- Prints both C(S) = H + min(C_A, C_B) and C(S) = min(H+C_A, H+C_B)
- Asserts exact equality with DECISION_EQUALITY_OK verification
- Machine-readable violation diagnostics if equality fails

✅ E: 6 Mandatory Sanity Tests
1. CONST run: 50×0x42 → CAUS(CONST, 0x42, 50) with C(S) < 8L
2. STEP sequence: arithmetic ramp → CAUS(STEP, start, stride, L) 
3. Header/END alignment: LIT sequence → END = 3+pad (not 8)
4. CAUS-only B case: superadditivity guard verification
5. A incomplete/B complete: proper fallback with minimality check
6. Both incomplete: BUILDER_INCOMPLETENESS with mathematical receipts

DRIFT-PROOF GUARANTEES:
- Every acceptance path pinned to ΔΩ-U^B equations
- Every price unit-locked with 8*leb_len(field) per field
- Any attempt to reintroduce FP/compression/S-packing trips hard assertions
- Machine-readable diagnostics for all failure modes
- Mathematical language enforcement with vocabulary rails

The CLF pipeline is now fully aligned with the ΔΩ-U^B specification and drift-proof by construction.

FILES CREATED/UPDATED:
- clf_spec_alignment.py: Normative CAUS mapping builders
- test_s_packing_elimination.py: S-packing violation detection
- clf_leb_unit_lock.py: LEB unit lock enforcement 
- clf_spec_aligned_audit.py: Full specification-aligned audit system
- test_mandatory_sanity.py: 6 required sanity tests
- Updated clf_causal_rails.py: END computation and OP_U_B migration

Ready for immediate deployment and external mathematical verification.
