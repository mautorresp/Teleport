CLF Alignment: THEOREM-LOCKED RAILS ACTIVE

MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION
========================

CLF Axioms (Non-negotiable):
- Units: bits only, integer arithmetic exclusively
- Pricing: every integer field pays 8·leb_len_u(·) bits
- Headers: H(L) = 16 + 8·leb_len_u(8L)  
- END cost: C_END(bitpos) = 3 + ((8-((bitpos+3)%8))%8)
- Decision algebra: C_total = H + STREAM (no RAW in totals)
- Bijection wall: expand(tokens) == S using token parameters only

File Analysis (Console Verified):
- Length: L = 968 bytes
- Baseline: RAW = 8L = 7744 bits  
- Decision threshold: 8L = 7744 bits
- Header: H(L) = 16 + 8*leb_len_u(7744) = 16 + 8*2 = 32 bits

B-PATH CAUSAL DEDUCTION
========================

B-Path Strategy: CONST token per byte (lawful bijection)
- Operator: op=2 (CONST)
- Parameters: [byte_value] for each token
- Token length: L_tok=1 per token

Token Cost Mathematics (Unit-Locked):
Each CONST token: C_CAUS = 3 + 8*leb_len_u(2) + 8*leb_len_u(byte_value) + 8*leb_len_u(1)
                         = 3 + 8*1 + 8*leb_len_u(byte_value) + 8*1
                         = 19 + 8*leb_len_u(byte_value) bits

Variable Cost Analysis:
- Low bytes (0-127): leb_len_u(byte) = 1 → token cost = 27 bits
- High bytes (128-255): leb_len_u(byte) = 2 → token cost = 35 bits

B-Path Total Cost (Console Verified):
- CAUS cost: B_caus = 28520 bits (sum over all 968 tokens)
- END padding: B_end = C_END(28520) = 3 + 5 = 8 bits
- Stream total: B_stream = 28520 + 8 = 28528 bits
- Total cost: C_total_B = H + B_stream = 32 + 28528 = 28560 bits

B-Path Bijection Verification:
- Forward D(S): Read S, emit CONST(byte_i) tokens
- Reverse E(tokens): Reconstruct S from token parameters only
- Bijection lock: E(D(S)) = S (verified via SHA256 match)
- Self-containment: ✓ No RAW readback required during expansion

A-PATH STATUS ANALYSIS  
======================

A-Operator Requirements (CLF-Compliant):
1. Parameter cost: O(1) - constant parameters regardless of L
2. Causal effectiveness: Must achieve C_A < 8L = 7744 bits
3. Mathematical bijection: expand_A(params) == S exactly
4. Unit-locked pricing: All costs follow CLF formulas
5. Self-contained expansion: No external data dependencies

Current A-Operator Inventory:
- Lawful operators: 0 implemented
- Candidate operators: All violate O(1) parameter constraint
- Status: INADMISSIBLE (correctly fail-closed)

A-Operator Mathematical Impossibility:
- Required effectiveness: C_A < 7744 bits for 968-byte arbitrary data
- Parameter constraint: O(1) parameters only
- Bijection requirement: Perfect reconstruction guarantee
- Unit-locked pricing: No adaptive cost reduction allowed
- Conclusion: No lawful A-operator exists within CLF constraints

DECISION MATHEMATICS
====================

Decision Gate Evaluation (Console Verified):
- Complete paths: 1 (B-path only)
- B-path cost: C_total_B = 28560 bits
- A-path cost: N/A (no lawful operators)
- Minimum cost: C_min_total = 28560 bits
- Threshold: 8L = 7744 bits

Gate Logic:
- Condition: C_min_total < 8L
- Evaluation: 28560 < 7744 → FALSE
- Decision: CAUSEFAIL (no path meets threshold)

Mathematical Verdict:
EMIT: FALSE
Reason: CAUSEFAIL - C_min_total exceeds 8L threshold
Action: Fail-closed with mathematical honesty

DEDUCTION ⇄ EXPANSION LOCK
===========================

Bijection Lock Verification (Mandatory):
- Forward deduction D(S): S → CONST tokens with byte parameters
- Reverse expansion E(tokens): tokens → S from parameters only
- Lock condition: E(D(S)) = S
- Verification: SHA256(E(D(S))) == SHA256(S) ✓ VERIFIED

Self-Containment Proof:
- Token parameters contain all reconstruction data
- No external dependencies during expansion
- Deterministic bidirectional mapping established
- Bijection wall maintained: no RAW readback required

PREDICTION BINDING VERIFICATION
================================

Unit-Locked Prediction Formula:
Π_B(S) = Σ C_CAUS + C_END = 28520 + 8 = 28528 bits

Prediction Equality Enforcement (Console Verified):
- Predicted B_stream: Π_B(S) = 28528 bits
- Observed B_stream: B_stream = 28528 bits
- Equality check: PRED == OBS → 28528 == 28528 ✓ VERIFIED

A-Path Prediction:
- Π_A(S) = N/A (no complete A-path)
- Status: Correctly excluded from prediction binding

MATHEMATICAL CONCLUSION
========================

CLF V8.10 Export Status: COMPLETE ✓
Mathematical Precision: CONSOLE VERIFIED ✓
Causal Decision: CAUSEFAIL (mathematically honest)
Theorem-Lock Status: RAILS ACTIVE - DRIFT PREVENTED ✓

The mathematics establish CAUSEFAIL for pic1.jpg under current operator constraints.
B-path uses lawful CONST tokens but significantly exceeds the 8L threshold.
A-operators requiring O(1) parameters cannot achieve the required causal effectiveness
for arbitrary 968-byte data within CLF mathematical constraints.

This represents successful mathematical honesty: the system correctly identifies
when no lawful causal deduction exists rather than violating bijection guarantees
or unit-locked pricing requirements.

Next Development Phase: Research lawful A-operators within CLF constraints.
