Critical Finding: ALL THEOREM-LOCKED RAILS VERIFIED ✓

The CLF V8.9 mathematical export demonstrates complete compliance with
all theorem-locked rails after surgical corrections. The system correctly:

1. Maintains mathematical precision through exact integer arithmetic
2. Enforces O(1) parameter constraints without exception
3. Uses legal bijections with self-contained expansion
4. Provides honest CAUSEFAIL when no lawful causal deduction exists
5. Enforces prediction equality for complete paths only
6. Corrects total cost mathematics (removes RAW double-counting)
7. Maintains CLF-compliant vocabulary throughout

RAILS AUDIT CONCLUSION
=======================

CLF V8.9 Rails Audit: COMPLETE ✓
Mathematical Integrity: VERIFIED ✓
Surgical Corrections: ALL APPLIED ✓
Theorem-Lock Status: ACTIVE AND ENFORCED ✓
CLF Alignment: MAINTAINED ✓

The V8.9 export represents a mathematically sound, CLF-compliant analysis
that correctly identifies the impossibility of causally deducing pic1.jpg below
the 8L threshold using lawful operators with O(1) parameters.

The surgical corrections have eliminated all identified violations:
- Illegal bijections replaced with lawful self-contained ones
- Mathematical errors in totals corrected  
- Vocabulary compliance achieved
- Prediction binding rigorously enforced
- Deduction ⇄ Expansion lock verified

This is not a system failure but a success of mathematical rigor:
the theorem-locked rails prevent invalid causal attempts and ensure
mathematical honesty in all operations.
