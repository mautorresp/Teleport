CLF WHOLE-STREAM EVIDENCE: PIC2.JPG (CORRECTED)
==============================================

## MATHEMATICAL FRAMEWORK
CLF enforces strict binary mathematics:
- H = 16 + 8*leb_len(8*L) (header cost)
- Per-token: C_stream_i < 10*L_i (strict bound)
- Global: H + sum(C_stream_i) < 10*L (minimality)
- Coverage: tokens must tile [0,L) exactly (no gaps)
- Expansion: seed-only reconstruction (no file access)

## FILE ANALYSIS
L = 456 bytes
SHA256 = 54868e56bc94daf9ceb20277eca2b2079198fed0b68d65d95aaed1c787993c18
H = 16 + 8*leb_len(8*456) = 16 + 8*2 = 32 bits
10*L = 4560 bits (decisive baseline)

## CLF DEDUCTION RESULT: OPEN
Complete causal coverage cannot be achieved.
compose_cover(S, 0, 456) raises OpenError at boundary analysis:

### Boundary Analysis
Segments that defeat causal encoding:
- Prefix [0:4]: JPEG header [255, 216, 255, 224]
  No operator beats 10*4 = 40 bit baseline
- Suffix [454:456]: JPEG footer [255, 217]
  Minimum token cost ≥ 32 bits > 10*2 = 20 bits

### Coverage Enforcement
CLF requires complete tiling [0,L) by admissible tokens.
Since boundary segments cannot be causally encoded,
complete coverage is impossible → OpenError → OPEN state.

### Interior Analysis (For Reference)
Interior segments have causal potential:
- [4:205]: 201 zeros → CONST(0) saves ~1970 bits
- [205:304]: 99-byte step → STEP saves ~950 bits
- [304:454]: 150 bytes of 0x42 → CONST(66) saves ~1460 bits
Total interior savings: ~4380 bits >> H = 32 bits

However, boundary constraints prevent complete coverage,
so CLF correctly classifies as OPEN (no seed emitted).

## CLF CLASSIFICATION
STATE: OPEN
SEED_EMITTED: None
REASON: Complete causal coverage impossible

## CLF COMPLIANCE VERIFICATION
✓ Coverage requirement enforced (no partial solutions)
✓ Header calculation: H = 32 bits (corrected)
✓ No mixed LIT mode (CLF specification compliant)
✓ Integer-exact mathematics (no floating point)
✓ Deterministic classification (no heuristics)
✓ Bijection requirement enforced (seed must reconstruct all bytes)
